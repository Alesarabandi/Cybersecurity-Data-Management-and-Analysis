## 🚀 **Project Workflow**
1. **📥 Data Acquisition**  
   - 🔗 Retrieval of cybersecurity datasets from APIs and external platforms like Kaggle.  
   - 🌍 Integration of IP address location data for attacker and victim analysis.  

2. **🗄️ Data Storage and Integration**  
   - 🛢️ Data stored and managed using **PostgreSQL**, ensuring structured and scalable handling.  
   - 🔀 Integration of multiple datasets into a unified schema for seamless analysis.  

3. **🧹 Data Preparation**  
   - 🧽 Cleaning, normalizing, and transforming raw data to enhance usability.  
   - 🛠️ Handling missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies to ensure data integrity.  

4. **✅ Data Quality Assessment**  
   - 📊 In-depth assessment of data quality metrics, including completeness and consistency.  
   - 🔍 Application of statistical methods to detect anomalies and refine data reliability.  

5. **📈 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - 📉 Visualization of cybersecurity trends using **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn**.  
   - 🌐 Identification of attack patterns, geographical distribution of attackers, and victim profiles.
   - 📊 For more in-depth insights, I have also created two interactive dashboards on Tableau, which you can access via the following links:

1. [Geospatial Map Dashboard](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/ali.sarabandi/viz/GeospatialMapDashboard/Dashboard1)
2. [Global Cyber Threat Dashboard](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/ali.sarabandi/viz/GlobalCyberThreatDashboard/Dashboard2)

On the top-left corner of each dashboard, you will find a hyperlink that leads to the documentation for the respective dashboard.
